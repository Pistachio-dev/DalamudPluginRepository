Not worth it.\n- Flowerpots are now counted as separate entities each, instead of being sometimes merged into one.\n- Newly registered plots or flowerpots will have the area name (for instance, Mist L 1 would be in a Large house in Mist)\n- Moved plots' location is updated when you see them again\n- Removed plots will print a warning so the user know they should delete them\n- Throttled and optimized the garden patch background lookup. It still only runs when the main window is open.\n- Flowerpots refuse to work properly. Just don't use this for flowerpots. Just don't.",
